### MVP User Stories

- As a user, I want to see advice that is the product of an API fetch request.

- As a user, I want to search for advice that is the product of interpolation of my input and the API URL.

- As a user, I want to experience the app as a single site, but want the functionality of being able to switch between information on different pages using React Router.

#### Silver User Stories

- As a user, I want the search bar to be replaced by text when I submit a search so that my advice appears the same on both pages for a more seamless experience.
